Bamboo Maps is the simplest way of embedding a fully functional Google Map into your content.

== Description ==

In three simple steps, you can have any fully interactive Google map embedded in any page of your website.

Setup the map as you want it in Google Maps.
Copy the link provided by Google.
Paste the link into your WordPress page and wrap it in our shortcode – Thats It!
Usage
Before you use this plugin you need to get the map you want from Google.

To do this go to Google Maps, search, zoom, or browse until it is showing the map you want. Click the Settings cog icon followed by ‘Share and embed map’ and copy the link that Google gives you.

Once you’ve got your link, paste it into your content and wrap it in a google-map shortcode:

[bamboo-map]
Your link from Google goes here
[/bamboo-map]

You can also use the following attributes in the shortcode to set it’s size:

width: Sets the width of the map using any valid CSS width, e.g. ‘400px’ or ’50%’.

height: Sets the heightof the map using any valid CSS width, e.g. ‘400px’ or ’50%’.
